Shell.FM 0.5 Installation


Requirements:
* libmad
* libao
* libtagc (optional)


Installation:

1. Run "make".
2. Run "make install" as root.
3. Read the manual for per-user setup information.

NOTE: The Makefile uses /usr as PREFIX and $PREFIX/man as MANDIR by default.
You can override those on the command line. For example, Debian/Ubuntu users
usually have their manuals in /usr/share/man, so they would install shell-fm
like this:

$ make install PREFIX=/usr MANDIR=/usr/share/man

NOTE: To install a stripped version of shell-fm (about 10K smaller), use
"install-strip" instead of "install":

$ make install-strip

To install to a temporary root (for example, when building a binary
package), you can use the DESTDIR variable, just like with autotools
packages.
